# Simple_Breast_Cancer_tumor_classifier

I have implement a simple machine learning algorithm in Python using Scikit-learn, a machine learning tool for Python.

Using "Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Database" dataset, I build a machine learning model to use tumor information to predict whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign.
